        Vector layers are layers that have sets of information associated with each&nbsp;
        pixel. Raster layers provide tiled PNGs or JPEGs that only have color values associated with each pixel.

    <Row className="p-3">
      <p>
        Some vector layers that have a vast number of features are&nbsp;
        rendered as raster images in outer zoom levels to enhance the&nbsp;
        speed of map interactions (dragging and zooming) these
        layers are render.

          If you see the pointer icon next to the layer, you should be able to click on that layer&#39;s features in order to access metadata associated with that feature.
